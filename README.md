# Nick Notes 


Free Thought
* landing page (has a nice image and description. Maybe goes over some of the features available)
* images & icons 
* add beers to a brewery and see them on brewery page 
* see beers sorted by rating 
* more advanced reviews
* edit brewery page
* more data points for Brewery (like dog access)
* see beers that are near my location (Yelp)
